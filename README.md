Welcome to Connect 4, a classic two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended 7x6 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four consecutive discs of the same color.

This implementation of Connect 4 is built using React for the front-end and Node.js with Socket.IO for the back-end, allowing for real-time multiplayer gameplay.

Features
Multiplayer Mode: Play against another player in real-time over the internet.
Spectator Mode: Watch ongoing games and switch between different games.
Responsive Design: The game is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
AI Integration: Coming soon! An AI opponent will be added for single-player gameplay.
